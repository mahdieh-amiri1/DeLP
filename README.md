DeLP - Decentralized Learning Platform

DeLP is a decentralized learning platform built on blockchain technology. It empowers educators, learners, and mentors to participate in a secure and transparent ecosystem for course creation, enrollment, and certification. DeLP combines the benefits of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and decentralized governance to create a trusted environment for learning and skill development.

Features

- **Course Creation**: Educators can create and publish courses, including course descriptions, fees, and content.
- **Course Enrollment**: Learners can enroll in courses by paying the registration fees in DeLT tokens.
- **Certification**: Upon successful completion of courses, learners receive NFT-based certificates that are signed by mentors.
- **Decentralized Governance**: DeLP utilizes Quadratic Voting for decentralized decision-making, allowing token holders to vote on platform upgrades and course rankings.

Demo

1. Creating a Course

To create a course on DeLP, follow these steps:

```solidity
function createCourse(string memory title, string memory description, uint256 registrationFee) external onlyOwner {
    // Code to create a new course and publish it on the platform
}
```

2. Enrolling in a Course

Learners can enroll in a course by transferring DeLT tokens. Here's how:

```solidity
function enrollInCourse(uint256 courseId) external {
    // Code to enroll a learner in a course
}
```

 3. Certification

Upon course completion, learners receive NFT-based certificates. Certificates are signed by mentors and are user-bound, ensuring authenticity.

4. Quadratic Voting

DeLP uses Quadratic Voting for decentralized governance. Token holders can vote on platform decisions, including course rankings and upgrades.

Getting Started

To get started with DeLP, you'll need to:

1. Deploy the DeLT token contract to your preferred Ethereum network.
2. Deploy the DeLP contracts (CourseManagementContract, UserBoundCertificate, QuadraticVoting) to the same network.
3. Configure your platform, including setting the initial parameters, such as fees and voting coefficients.

For detailed deployment and configuration instructions, please refer to the [Deployment Guide](deployment-guide.md) in this repository.
