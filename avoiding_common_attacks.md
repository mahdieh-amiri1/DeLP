# Avoiding Common Smart Contract Attacks

DeLP (Decentralized Learning Platform) is committed to ensuring the security and reliability of its smart contracts. To achieve this, the platform incorporates various security measures to mitigate common vulnerabilities and attacks. This document outlines some of the security considerations and measures implemented in DeLP contracts.

## 1. Access Control

- **Role-Based Access**: Access control mechanisms are implemented using Ownable.sol library, limiting certain functions to specific user role such as owner.

- **Modifiers**: Careful use of modifiers is employed to check whether a user has the required permissions before executing specific functions. Modifiers help ensure that only authorized users can access certain features. For example, only a course creator can update its course related parameters such as content, update students status to "Passed" or issue certificate for students that they have passed the course.

## 2. Reentrancy Vulnerability

- **Use of Withdraw Pattern**: When interacting with external contracts, we follow best practices for avoiding reentrancy attacks by implementing the "withdraw pattern." This involves performing state changes after sending funds to external contracts.

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Parameter Validation**: Functions in our smart contracts are designed to check for valid parameters and values, and invalid inputs are rejected with appropriate error messages.

## 4. Minimized External Dependencies

- **Reduced External Contracts**: We aim to reduce dependencies on external contracts to minimize potential vulnerabilities associated with third-party contracts. When necessary, external contracts are thoroughly audited and selected with care.

## 5. Code Review

- **Code Review**: All smart contract code has been subjected to code reviews to catch vulnerabilities early in the development process.
