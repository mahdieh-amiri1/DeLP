In the development of DeLP (Decentralized Learning Platform), we made several design pattern decisions to ensure the security, scalability, and efficiency of the platform. Below are some of the key design patterns we adopted:

Smart Contract Structure

Modularization

We adopted a modular approach to smart contract development. Each major component of the platform, such as course management, certification, and quadratic voting, is implemented in separate smart contracts. This modularization enhances code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

Ownable Contracts

We use the Ownable pattern from the OpenZeppelin library for contracts that require access control. This pattern ensures that only the contract owner has administrative rights, enhancing security.

Token Standards

ERC-20 Token

For the platform's native token, DeLT, we chose the ERC-20 standard. ERC-20 is widely recognized, well-tested, and compatible with various wallets and exchanges. It provides flexibility for token management.

Security Measures

SafeMath Library

While the newer versions of Solidity include safe arithmetic operations, we have incorporated the SafeMath library to prevent integer overflow and underflow issues in arithmetic calculations, ensuring the security of our contracts.

Decentralized Governance

Quadratic Voting

To facilitate decentralized decision-making, we implemented Quadratic Voting. This voting mechanism allows token holders to vote on platform upgrades and course rankings proportionally to their token holdings, promoting a fair and transparent governance system.

Data Storage and Optimization

Minimized Storage Reads

We minimize storage reads by directly accessing the required data within functions, reducing gas costs. This optimization keeps our contracts gas-efficient without compromising security.

Continuous Improvement

The design pattern decisions we've made are not static. We continuously assess and improve our design patterns as the platform evolves, incorporating best practices and optimizations to ensure a secure and efficient learning environment for all participants.
